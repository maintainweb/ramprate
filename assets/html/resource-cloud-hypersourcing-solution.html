Many enterprise data center managed services clients are enterprises that missed out on early adoption of cloud technology and are now striving to catch up. Many business decision makers suffer from confusion over key questions about the true cost, risk, and total economic impact of moving their core applications to the cloud.

Cloud HyperSourcing provides an objective third-party process for creating the definitive business case for moving app workloads to an enterprise cloud. It supports multi-supplier and hybrid deployment scenarios. The end result is alignment on cost and TCO transparency for business and IT decision makers.

The solution addresses managed, unmanaged, and “shadow IT” workloads. It enables buyers to adopt a multi-supplier, best-fit approach for applications. Such an approach offers buyers a wide range of service-provider options, thus ensuring optimal deployment efficiencies. Companies are afforded the freedom to place workloads on cloud infrastructures with the greatest efficiency and least risk, while leveraging best-of-breed managed services and tools for a single point of control for their application lifecycles.</div>
